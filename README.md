# nodoc
Start by writing no documentation. Continue by not commenting your code and not logging anything out of it.
Keep all information for yourself. Ask everybody everytime you need to know something as no information is available.

Please note that this README is a bad practice and shouldn't exist. Unfortunately it helps people understanding the goal of this project so it isn't compliant with the project itself.
